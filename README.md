# mckinsey_and_scikit
Prohack competition organized by Mckinsey&Company motivated me to create this notebook. Prohack was the first data science competition, that I participated in. Although I didn't achieve incredible results during the competition, I dedicated decent amount of time to it, and, as such, I decided to invest some more time to better structure and comment everything. As I extensively used scikit library for data preprocessing and modeling, this notebook became not just the search for solution, but the guide on how to use scikit in supervised learning regression problems with the input data of many dimensions.
